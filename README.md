# hangman_python
A hangman game for a job interview.
This is the Hangman python file. It is meant to be run in a terminal using python3. There are ten words to play from. You'll have to download the hangman.py file and run it with the terminal command: python3 hangman.py
Ex.

your_computer ~ % python3 hangman.py

Make your terminal window large enough so the text doesn't cut off too confusingly, the game has the text wrapping that will organize it when the screen is large enough.

Enjoy!
